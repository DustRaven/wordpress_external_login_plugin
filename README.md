#External Login

See readme.txt for the main information for the plugin.
This is done to save duplication as readme.txt is required for WordPress plugin repository.

##Special Thanks
A special thank you to Ben Lobaugh for a [great article](https://ben.lobaugh.net/blog/7175/wordpress-replace-built-in-user-authentication) which I used heavily for this plugin.

##Future Plans
- Add Social Login with:
    - Facebook
    - Google
    - Github
- Ability to prepend user names in WP with a string to separate WP users from those generated with external login
- Add a custom login screen
